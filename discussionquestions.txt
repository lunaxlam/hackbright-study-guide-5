Discussion Questions

SECTION 1: SQLAlchemy
- What is an ORM?

    ORMs or "Object Relational Mappers" is how we can turn Python objects into SQL.
    For example:

        class Cat (db.Model):
        """Feline cactus."""

        __tablename__ = "cats"

        cat_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False, unique=True)
        color = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=True)
        hunger = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False, default=20)

    ... turns into SQL like this:

        CREATE TABLE cats (
            cat_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            color VARCHAR(10),
            hunger INTEGER NOT NULL
        );

- How to define and create new tables in SQLAlchemy?

    Use: db.create_all()

- SQLAlchemy methods to know

    .filter()

    .filter_by()

    .all(), .one(), .first()

- JOINs in SQLAlchemy

- Relationships in SQLAlchemy

- What is the purpose of a backref in SQLAlchemy?

    Backrefs are a way to define relationships that make them easier to define and/or use. 

SECTION 2: Data Modeling
- Types of relationships
    One-to-many

    One-to-one

    Many-to-many

- Association tables, middle tables

- How to draw data model diagrams

- What is data normalization?

    Data normalization refers to the practice of a piece of information existing in exactly one place and relates directly to the key.
    It prevents repeating dependencies (i.e. storing a person's age and name in two places) and representing multiple data for the same category in columns. 

- What is referential integrity?

    Referential integrity refers to the logical depenency of a foreign key on a primary key; or the relationship between tables.
    You cannot delete rows from the parent table before you delete rows from the child table. 
    You also cannot create rows from the child table.
